### **TRAVEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**  

**OVERVIEW:** 

1. Limited Travel Planning Resources
 Travelers often face difficulties in identifying optimal routes, transportation modes, and accommodations. 
 A lack of centralized systems for information makes planning cumbersome and inefficient.
 
2. Safety and Accessibility Concerns
 Concerns regarding safety, particularly for solo or female travelers, and a lack of accessible
 options for individuals with disabilities limit travel opportunities for certain groups.

3. Infrastructure and Connectivity Issues
 Poor transport infrastructure, lack of seamless connectivity between cities, and insufficient facilities 
 like clean rest stops or reliable transport services make travel inconvenient.

4. Booking Inefficiencies
 Manual or outdated booking systems often lead to delays, double bookings, or mismanagement, 
 impacting the overall user experience.

5. Customer Feedback and Support Challenges
 Inadequate mechanisms to gather feedback or address traveler issues result in dissatisfaction and 
 reduced user engagement with the system.

**Technical Stack:**  
Languages: C++
Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, KMP, Graph Traversal (ADJACENT MATRIX), Boyer Moore 

Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

**Impact:** 
1. Streamlined Travel Planning:
     Simplifies the process of selecting optimal routes and destinations, saving time and reducing stress for travelers.
2. Increased Accessibility:
     Provides better connectivity to remote or less-known destinations, boosting tourism and local economies.     
3. Safety and Security Assurance:
     Promotes safe travel through informed decision-making, building trust among users and stakeholders.
4. Data-Driven Personalization:
     Offers tailored travel experiences based on user preferences, enhancing satisfaction and creating memorable journeys.
5. Better Feedback Integration:
    Improves service quality by incorporating user feedback, fostering loyalty and long-term engagement.
